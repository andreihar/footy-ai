		"text1": "Welcome to Footy AI! Inspired by the excitement and unpredictability of the UEFA Euro tournaments, Footy AI aims to bring a unique blend of historical analysis and modern technology to football enthusiasts around the world.",
		"title2": "My Story",
		"text2": "The idea for Footy AI was born out of my love for football and a fascination with the potential of artificial intelligence. With the UEFA Euro 2024 tournament approaching, I set out to create an AI that could predict the outcomes of football matches between any national teams, from any period in history. My goal was to see how well the AI could predict the current Euro tournament and to explore the historical odds of teams winning in past tournaments.",
		"title3": "What I Offer",
		"text3": "Footy AI provides a comprehensive platform to visualise and interact with the predictions generated by the AI. Here's what you can explore on the website:",
		"list": {
			"title1": "Overall Tournament Statistics",
			"text1": "Track how well the AI predicts the outcomes of the current Euro 2024 or any previous tournament.",
			"title2": "Group Stage Predictions",
			"text2": "Dive into detailed predictions for each group stage match, from total points to goal difference.",
			"title3": "Knockout Stage Predictions",
			"text3": "See how the AI forecasts the outcomes of knockout stage matches.",
			"title4": "Custom Match-Ups",
			"text4": "Create custom match-ups between any two UEFA countries that were members of the association during a specific Euro tournament."
		},
		"title4": "How It Works",
		"text4": "The AI leverages historical data and advanced machine learning algorithms to generate predictions. The model is trained on the historical outcomes with the assist of ELO system. This allows to provide accurate and insightful predictions for both historical and contemporary match-ups, while keeping the prediction model minimal to ensure fast and efficient performance.",
		"text4.1": "You can find the Jupyter notebook containing the AI model in the \"server\" folder of the <b>GitHub repository</b>. This repository also contains the code for the website, allowing you to explore and contribute to the project.",
		"title5": "My Mission",
		"text5": "At Footy AI, my mission is to enhance the experience of football fans by combining the rich history of the sport with cutting-edge technology. Whether you're curious about past tournaments or excited about the current Euro, I aim to provide a fun and informative platform for all football enthusiasts.",
		"text6": "Thank you for visiting Footy AI. I hope you enjoy exploring the predictions and insights as much as I enjoyed creating them. If you have any questions, feedback, or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out!"
