<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

HOWL Gaming is the comprehensive esports organisation website developed after taking a high school Web Design course in Spring 2019.

The original version was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In a recent update, the website was rewritten using React and the i18n localisation library to reduce the number of pages and have consistent Navbar and Footer styling everywhere on the website.

The website provides detailed information about the team's players, coaches, matches, and achievements. It also includes a news section that covers tournament overviews and detailed match descriptions.

The Team Page provides comprehensive insights into each team, including player details, coaching staff, overall team information, global statistics, match records, achievements, and team history. To ensure efficient content management and prevent duplication, all team-related data is consolidated within a central file `teams.js`. This data is dynamically retrieved and presented on the corresponding team pages, ensuring consistency and ease of updates.
