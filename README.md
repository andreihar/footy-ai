<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Footy AI is a unique end-to-end platform developed in anticipation of the UEFA Euro 2024 tournament.

The application aims to enrich the engagement of football enthusiasts with the UEFA Euro tournaments by using artificial intelligence. The AI leverages matches and ELO data to predict match outcomes and provide insightful statistics. This platform not only focuses on the current Euro 2024 tournament but also offers a retrospective view of past tournaments, allowing users to explore the historical odds and performances of their national teams.

Footy AI offers comprehensive statistics for tournaments, detailed match predictions, and the ability to create custom match-ups between any UEFA national teams. It also includes interactive visualisations and insights into the AI's prediction accuracy, enhancing the experience for users who want to explore football data in depth.

```



<!-- FEATURES -->
## Features

### Overview Page

The Overview Page serves as the central hub, providing a summary of the AI's prediction performance for a certain tournament. Users can see recent predictions and their outcomes, as well as visual representations of the AI's overall and daily prediction accuracy.

</p>

### Custom Match

The Custom Match Page allows users to create custom match-ups between any two UEFA countries from any historical period of the Euro tournaments. Users can see the AI's predictions for these hypothetical matches, and define whether they want the draw option to be available, providing a fun and interactive way to explore potential outcomes of dream match-ups.

### Prediction Model

Footy AI uses a robust prediction model using Linear Regression to predict goal differences based on ELO differences. Linear Regression is chosen for its simplicity and effectiveness in modelling the relationship between ELO ratings and goal differences. The model is trained on the [International football results][results] dataset, and incorporates [ELO Ratings from 1901 to 2024][elo]. Expected Goals (xG) are used to normalise goal scoring based on team performance, serving as the main prediction attribute. ELO Ratings quantify team strength, allowing the model to account for the relative strengths of the teams, leading to more accurate predictions. To reflect the random nature of goal scoring, Poisson Distribution is used to simulate match scores. The model uses data from all international matches over the past four years from the starting date of the tournament, so as to consider semi-major player changes. The prediction percentages are determined after simulating 10,000 matches.
